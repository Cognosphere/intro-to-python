#PRACTICE PROBLEM
#Define a dogâ€™s name, breed, color, and age. Then, add those variables into a sentence

#SOLUTION:
dog_name = "Max"
dog_breed = "poodle"
dog_color = "white"
dog_age = 5

#Method 1:
print("My {}-year old dog {} is a {} {}".format(dog_age, dog_name, dog_color, dog_breed))

#Method 2:
print("My {3}-year old dog {0} is a {2} {1}".format(dog_name, dog_breed, dog_color, dog_age))

#Method 3:
print(f"My {dog_age}-year old dog {dog_name} is a {dog_color} {dog_breed}")
