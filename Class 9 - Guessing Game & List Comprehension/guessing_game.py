#how to use random module:
print(random.randint(1,100)) #print number between 1,100
print("\n\n\n")

'''
First, pick a random number from 1 to 50 using the random module and assign it to a variable

'''
Make a list to store guesses

'''
Write a while loop that asks for a guess.

while True:
    pass

'''
Make a while loop that compares the player's guess to our number. If the player guesses correctly, break out of the loop. 
Otherwise, tell the player if they're WARMER or COLDER, and continue asking for guesses.
Some hints:
    it may help to sketch out all possible combinations on paper first!
    you can use the abs() function to find the positive difference between two numbers
    if you append all new guesses to the list, then the previous guess is given as guesses[-2]

while True:

    # we can copy the code from above to take an input
